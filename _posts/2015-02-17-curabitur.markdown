<img src="/images/fulls/03.jpg" class="fit image"> I think it is very important for students to know what kind of learner they are. We need to know about it so I am going to talk about how I learned at school and home, what the hardest and easiest tasks are for me and how I can succeed at university.

When I learn something from school and home, I usually focus on visible things that I can watch or read. For example, in school, I always prefer to sit in front of a teacher and try to keen eye contact because it is easy to pay attention to the teacherâ€™s lecture or visual things such as a PPT or a video.

Another key of my learning style is taking notes. It is a very important thing for me. When I watch a lecture, I always take notes with highlighters, circling words and underlining. Even if subjects are hard to understand or confusing, once I make notes in my own style I can easily comprehend and remember.

It is very effective for me.
